# Jaded

Quick Jade-based static(ish) website generator.

Cross-between hard coded pages and pages in the `markdown` folder.

This isn't a perfecy system, and it's not meant to be, it's meant to be a simple no-nonsense Jade and markdown powered site that is quick to launch and get up and running without any hassle.

### Posts

Posts are stored in the `markdown/` folder as `.md` files, you can access them at anytime by using the `posts` template tag in your templates or you can use the `latest` template tag to get the latest post.

Posts in this case are in a more long-form format, rather than the traditional blog posts, but that works for this system just fine :)
